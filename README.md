# Pace-Landmarks
A Deep Learning Classification System in Python on TensorFlow that recognizes landmarks at Pace University by training the system and validating on data using the pictures taken around university.


• A deep learning classification system using Python in TensorFlow that recognizes landmarks at Pace University.
• Trained the deep learning model and validated it on a dataset of pictures taken around the University, tested it on a separate dataset to measure the accuracy rate of the program, and optimized it for the best results.
